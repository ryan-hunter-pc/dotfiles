# My Dotfiles

These are my local overrides, intended to be used with [Thoughtbot's Dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

## Install on a new machine

1. Follow the instructions to install the [Thoughbot dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).
2. Clone this repo into `~/dotfiles-local` to serve as the overrides as recommended in the Thoughtbot dotfiles readme.

## Updating these overrides

After making any updates to these overrides, run `rcup` from the home directory to update the symlinks or the updates will not be picked up.
